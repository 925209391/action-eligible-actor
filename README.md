[![Test](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-eligible-actor/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-eligible-actor/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![CodeQL](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-eligible-actor/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-eligible-actor/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

> Execute a GitHub Action only if the (triggering) actor is eligible (=authorised) to do so.

## Use Case

Assume you have multiple workflows and a complex set of rules who can manually
trigger which workflow. Instead of adding `if` conditions here and there you can
define a set of rules (in `eligible-actors-rules.json`) and use this rule in
multiple places. The management of the rules is centralized in one place.

But even if you only have a `deployment.yml` or `release.yml` workflow, this
action can be very useful.

## Usage

Add the action to your workflow, define `rulesFile` and the `ruleId` to
apply to and decide if the workflow should fail silently (`failSilently`) or
not.

### Before

```yml
- name: Release Tag
  if: ${{ github.actor == 'username' }}
  run: npx semantic-release
```

### After

```yml
- name: Can actor release?
  uses: natterstefan/action-eligible-actor@v1
  with:
    rulesFile: 'eligible-actors-rules.json' # default
    ruleId: 1 # required

# if `failSilently` for the rule with the id `1` was set to `false`, this step
# will not start if the actor is not eligible (included in `eligibleActors`).
# Instead the workflow will exit with 1 (=failure).
- name: Release Tag
  run: npx semantic-release
```

With the following `eligible-actors-rules.json` ([type definition](src/types.ts#L14-L36)):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "description": "Repository owner only",
    "eligibleActors": ["natterstefan"],
    "failureMessage": "Only the repository owner can do this!",
    "failSilently": false
  }
]
```

Take a look at more examples in the
[`test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml#L24) Workflow file.

## Development

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This
> won't work with versions older than 16, for instance.

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Build the package for distribution

```bash
# package the source files
npm run package
# afterward create a release with the release GitHub action
```

Run the tests

```bash
npm run package # or npm run dev (watch mode)
npm test
```

Test the workflow locally with <https://github.com/nektos/act>!

```bash
npm run package # or npm run dev (watch mode)
act -j testFailSilentyTrue && act -j testFailSilentyFalse
```

## Todos / To be discussed

- [ ] add `actor` input instead of implicitly using `process.env.GITHUB_ACTOR`.

## Alternatives

- [natterstefan/action-authorised-actor](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-authorised-actor): configure if the current actor is authorised to run the workflow with GitHub Secrets.
- [actions-cool/check-user-permission: ðŸ‘® A GitHub Action to check user permission of the current repository.](https://github.com/actions-cool/check-user-permission)
- [im-open/is-actor-authorized: Action that determines if the actor who initiated the workflow is authorized to do so.](https://github.com/im-open/is-actor-authorized)
